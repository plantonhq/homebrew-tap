  # A complete install includes the terminal half: the planton CLI ships as
  # its own formula (its own release cadence, its own `planton upgrade`), and
  # depending on it here means `brew install planton-desktop` delivers both,
  # with brew owning the CLI's updates. Direct-DMG installs get the same
  # completeness through the app's in-app CLI install offer instead.

  caveats <<~CAVEAT
    On first launch, picking the Local instance downloads its runtime
    (control plane + datastores, a few hundred MB) into ~/.planton/cache.

  # Bundle id per tauri.conf.json's identifier (a stale ai.planton.desktop id
  # here once pointed zap at directories the app never writes).
