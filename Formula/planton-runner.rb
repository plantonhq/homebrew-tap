      Planton Runner is a unified agent that establishes a secure reverse tunnel
      to the Planton Control Plane for cloud operations and IaC execution.

      Quick Start

      1. Register a runner and generate credentials:

         planton runner register --name my-runner
         planton runner generate-credentials my-runner

      2. Start the runner in gRPC mode (CloudOps):

         planton-runner \\
           --channel-id org.myorg.runner.my-runner \\
           --tunnel-host runner-tunnel.planton.live \\
           --ca-cert ~/.planton/certs/ca.crt \\
           --agent-cert ~/.planton/certs/agent.crt \\
           --agent-key ~/.planton/certs/agent.key

      3. Check the version:

         planton-runner version

      Prerequisites (for IaC operations in temporal/dual mode)

        brew install pulumi
        brew install opentofu
        brew install go

      For more help, run:

         planton-runner --help
